# onnoy-a-queue-management-system

**Project Description:**

“Onnoy” is a free platform where people can wait in a virtual queue. Using “Onnoy” web service, we can create a virtual queue and the customers or visitors can view the token calling progress and view the whole queue, and notify when their token is called. The authorities have to simply share the virtual queue code with the customers then everyone can view the queue.

**Objective:**
1. Reduce of risk of people gathering during COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Saving the cost of building the same service for each organization.
3. Faster token distribution.
4. Customer satisfaction.

**Motivation:**

In our daily lives, we often have to wait in a queue of people to receive a service in a hospital, bank, or a customer service point, etc. It is very annoying to us waiting in a line of people and it is also dangerous for the COVID-19 pandemic situation. On the other hand, many organizations have built their own token calling system which is costly too and those are not cloud-based so other organizations cannot use it.
So we want to develop “Onnoy” platform to overcome those problems. Here everyone can use the same service at the same time. Using “Onnoy” platform for both customers and authority will be beneficial.
